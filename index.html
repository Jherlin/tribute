            <strong>Elon Reeve Musk</strong> is an entrepreneur and business magnate. 
            He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; 
            early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; 
            founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and 
            OpenAI.
        </p>

            Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and 
            raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the <em>University 
            of Pretoria</em> before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid conscription. 
            He was enrolled at <em>Queen's University</em> and transferred to the University 
            of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree 
            in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford 
            University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the 
            web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired 
            by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, 
            which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 
            2002 for $1.5 billion.

            In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, 
            of which he is CEO and Chief Engineer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. 
            (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, 
            a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, 
            a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology 
            company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has 
            proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.
